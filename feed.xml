I do not want to receive these notifications before or after hours (computer stays on and we’re a 24/7 operation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can manipulate kdeconnect from the command line with kdeconnect-cli, but there is no mechanism for scheduling alerts on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first test used the ‘–pair’ and ‘–unpair’ commands found in kdeconnect-cli, but this deletes all of your in-app settings (i.e. what features are enabled).  This is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the solution I come up with.  It involves using crontab to kill the kdeconnect daemon (/usr/libexec/kdeconnectd), then restart the daemon, then run the ‘kdeconnect-cli –refresh’ command.  There is a bit of a delay needed between starting the daemon and the refresh command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many x86 development boards on the market today.  The ones I considered, in no particular order were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minnowboard.org/&quot;&gt;MinnowBoard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udoo.org/udoo-x86/&quot;&gt;UDOO x86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.up-board.org/&quot;&gt;UP board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaguarboard.org/&quot;&gt;Jaguarboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 4, only 2 had models with more than 4GB’s of RAM.  OpenShift recommended specifications are 16Gb’s of RAM per node, so I thought anything less than 4 would be a stretch.  I chose the UP board based on the fact that it was the same size as a raspberry pi, which would give me many more options for cases and accessories, that it was slightly cheaper, and that it was available for shipping to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/20180424_083037.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/20180424_083037.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;His name is Orangez&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The 3 nodes and my assistant&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the boards arrived I &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.up-community.org/Bios_Update&quot;&gt;updated their firmware &lt;/a&gt;and installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4.  I considered using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-linux-atomic-host-datasheet&quot;&gt;RHEL Atomic Host &lt;/a&gt;but decided on standard RHEL as I have more experience with it.  Alternatively, you can use Centos 7.4 with identical results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Firmware Installation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/index&quot;&gt;install&lt;/a&gt; was fairly straightforward, the only customisation was trying to determine the filesystem layout.  I needed storage for the OS and a separate volume group for the container images.  The boards have 32Gb of eMMC storage, so I opted for 5 Gb for the OS, 20 Gb for images, and everything else (/run, /boot, swap) in what was left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then started and enabled sshd, set static IP’s and hostnames, configured /etc/hosts, and ran subscription-manager (RHEL Licensing) on all the nodes to prepare them for OpenShift installation.  I also created 20 NFS shares on a USB 3 Flash Drive on the ‘Master’ node for OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/20180420_095502.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/20180420_095502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Melvin Hop Shocker IIPA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mocked up in case&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tiny OpenShift cluster will cost me approximately $2.77 (AUD) to run 24 hours a day for a month.  Each node draws a maximum of 4W, and the switch adds a maximum of 1W.  For comparison, a 3 node cluster built on desktop class workstations with 300W power supplies costs my colleague $192 (AUD) a month.  As a learning platform, that is a significant amount of savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cover the OpenShift installation in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sclarkso@redhat.com</name></author><category term="tech" /><category term="openshift" /><category term="rhmap" /><summary type="html">I decided I needed an OpenShift cluster at home for testing, and instead of doing it the easy way with Minishift, I decided I wanted to try to do it the hard way and run it on some sort of development board.   Given that my eventual goal was to run Red Hat’s Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) on the OpenShift on this cluster,  I felt that an ARM-based board was probably outside of my capabilities and I started researching Intel x86 based boards.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Variable Expansion in Sudo over SSH with Passwords</title><link href="https://sclarkso.github.io/2018/04/04/variable-expansion-in-sudo-over-ssh-with-passwords.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Variable Expansion in Sudo over SSH with Passwords" /><published>2018-04-04T19:28:56-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-04T19:28:56-05:00</updated><id>https://sclarkso.github.io/2018/04/04/variable-expansion-in-sudo-over-ssh-with-passwords</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sclarkso.github.io/2018/04/04/variable-expansion-in-sudo-over-ssh-with-passwords.html">&lt;p&gt;The trick is to set the ssh command as a variable so that the expansion happens at the correct time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a precursor, many of my automations revolve around binary data from sensors.  I use Xiaomi sensors as they’re easy to get, cheap, and easy to integrate into Home Assistant).  They use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee&quot;&gt;Zigbee&lt;/a&gt; protocol, which allows sensors to communicate back to the gateway via other sensors.  There is a single gateway that is connected to my network and each of the sensors in turn communicates with that gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating the Xiaomi gateway is an involved process requiring the use of Xiaomi’s android app in order to get a ‘security’ key for the device.  I followed the HASS (Home Assistant) guide here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/components/xiaomi_aqara/&quot;&gt;https://home-assistant.io/components/xiaomi_aqara/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All CLI configuration for HASS is done via YAML files, and follows much of the same formatting as Ansible.  So luckily knowledge of one helps with the other.  I have anxiety about the garage door being left open, so this was one of the first automations I worked on.  It uses a Xiaomi door sensor I have mounted on the arm of the garage door opener.  It’s basically a reed switch with a Zigbee module.  If the magnet in the small module isn’t holding the circuit in the large module closed, then an ‘open’ signal is sent to the gateway and ultimately HASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/gd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sensors&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mounted Sensor just above quick disconnect arm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the garage door opens, I use an automation to send me an alert.  All of this code can be in the main configuration.yaml, or can be separated out into child YAML files, which get included in the configuration.yaml.  I have my system set up like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- alias: Garage door open
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_XXXX
    from: 'off'
    to: 'on'
    for:
      seconds: 10
  action:
  - service: shell_command.take_garage_image
  - service: notify.pushbullet
    data:
      message: &quot;Garage Door is OPEN&quot;
      data:
        file: /tmp/camera.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trigger section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the configuration that tells the automation what to ‘listen’ for.  The ‘alias’ is just a friendly name for the automation in the UI.  The ‘platform’ just signifies that this automation works with the state of a sensor, and not for instance when a button is pressed, which is ‘platform: event’.  ‘entity_id’ is HASS’s internal name for the door sensor on the garage door.  ‘from’ and ‘to’ are telling this automation in which direction to fire.  So you could have a different event if the door was opened, versus when it closed.  When the switches open, sometimes they fire back and forth open and closed, which can cause issues with automation, so I put the ‘for’ condition in, just to prevent false alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the configuration that tells the automation what to do when the trigger condition is met.  ‘Service’ is basically any sort of automation or action you want to take.  You can send an email, or a text, or call a script.  You can also use jinja to call a service based on additional conditions.  My ‘shell_command.take_garage_image’ service uses the ‘shell_command’ component to run a shell command on the raspberry pi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Shell Commands
shell_command:
  pb_send_image: ~/.homeassistant/python_scripts/pb_send_file.py
  take_garage_image: ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -y -i rtsp://10.0.0.233:554/unicast -vframes 2 /tmp/camera.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case that command uses FFMPEG to scrape an image from a camera located in the garage, and saves that image to /tmp/camera.jpg.  The next service then sends me that image with pushbullet.  Originally I used another service ‘shell_command.pb_send_image’ that used a python script to send me the image with pushbullet, but in a recent update of HASS, that feature was added into the pushbullet component, but it was good practice to write that script in python nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this automation, I am using the new ‘alerts’ feature, to send me an ongoing alert if the garage door stays open (which is dismissible in the UI, if I want to dismiss the alert), and when it closes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;garage_door:&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
  name: 'Garage door is still OPEN '
  done_message: 'Garage door is CLOSED '
  entity_id: binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_XXXX
  state: 'on'
  repeat: 1
  can_acknowledge: True
  skip_first: True
  notifiers:
    - steven_phone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In alerts, the ‘name’ is the data that is sent in the alert.  So I get a pushbullet message after 1 minute (and every 1 minute ongoing, curtesy of the ‘repeat’ line) saying that the Garage door is still open, and a time stamp (as pushbullet is sometimes delayed).  Then when the door closes the ‘done_message’ is fired and I get an alert that the door is closed.  The ‘can_acknowledge’ line allows me to dismiss the ongoing alert in the UI.  The ‘notifiers’ section tells the alert what the alert, which is defined in the main configuration.yaml.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sclarkso@redhat.com</name></author><category term="HASS" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html">In my previous post I went over basically how to get Home Assistant up and running.  In this post I will document one of the automations I have written.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Integrating MyAir with Home Assistant</title><link href="https://sclarkso.github.io/hass/tech/2018/02/26/integrating-myair-with-home-assistant.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Integrating MyAir with Home Assistant" /><published>2018-02-26T18:51:34-06:00</published><updated>2018-02-26T18:51:34-06:00</updated><id>https://sclarkso.github.io/hass/tech/2018/02/26/integrating-myair-with-home-assistant</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sclarkso.github.io/hass/tech/2018/02/26/integrating-myair-with-home-assistant.html">&lt;p&gt;The heating and cooling in my new home was controlled by an app running on a cheap android tablet mounted on the wall called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advantageair.com.au/product/myair/&quot;&gt;MyAir&lt;/a&gt;.  That tablet is directly wired to a control unit, but you can install an app on other mobile devices (IOS/Android only) that communicate with the tablet to control the air conditioning/heat (and lights if you have that feature; I do not).  The app is limited in the options it provides and I wanted more control over my air conditioning from any device (including PC’s).  I decided to see if this was possible.  I started out planning to write a simple webpage to display the temperatures throughout the house and simply control things, but then decided to leverage an existing project for home automation called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io&quot;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;”  This made it both quicker and easier to integrate with other home automation technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed to do was to see if there was an API and if it was open.  Without both of those, it would be much more difficult to code a solution.  I started by sniffing the traffic from the app on my android phone.  The first step in that process was to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org&quot;&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/a&gt; running on my network.  I installed it on an existing raspberry pi on my network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing and running mitmproxy is simple, and covered well here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/install.html&quot;&gt;http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/install.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;mitmproxy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was to set up that proxy on my android device, and then using the app to change some settings in my Air Conditioning system so I could see the API calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/mitmsanitized.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/mitmsanitized.png&quot; alt=&quot;mitmproxy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app uses an API with no authentication, that runs over HTTP.  Because of this I was able to quickly determine the endpoints for displaying the current temperature in every room which was my first goal with this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/hass-sanitized1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sclarkso.github.io/assets/images/hass-sanitized1.png&quot; alt=&quot;HASS GUI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HASS GUI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then got Home Assistant (referred to as ‘HASS’ going forward) up and running on a raspberry pi (which is also running as a DIY google home, https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/, giving me the future ability to control HASS with my voice).  There is an image based version of HASS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/&quot;&gt;https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/&lt;/a&gt;), designed for raspberry pi’s and this is the easiest way to get HASS up and running.  As I already had lots of software and configuration done on the raspberry pi for different projects, I decided to use python virtual environments instead.  This had the added benefit of giving me more practice working with python virtual environments.  I followed the install guide here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/&quot;&gt;https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/&lt;/a&gt; and was up and running without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then had to write a custom sensor in order to display this information in HASS and be able to use the information dynamically in other automations and alerts.  HASS configuration is all done in YAML, and the sensor I wrote is written in python (which I have been trying to learn).  Through HASS’s documentation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/docs/&quot;&gt;https://home-assistant.io/docs/, https://home-assistant.io/cookbook/&lt;/a&gt;) and other people’s completed sensors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;https://community.home-assistant.io/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&amp;amp;type=Repositories&quot;&gt;https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&amp;amp;type=Repositories&lt;/a&gt;) I was able to get a working sensor together over the course of a few hours.  I can now see the temperature in every room with a temperate sensor installed, and going forward will be able to automatically adjust the temperature in those rooms based on occupancy, time of day, and any other sensing available to HASS (which is extensive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
